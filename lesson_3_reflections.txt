When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	- When you are working in a group
	- Or if you want to make your project public so the community can build it.
	These are times when creating a remote repository would come in quite handy.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	- It would take control away from you. If someone is working a project locally and then Git pull the latest remote repo
	then it can create a real mess because the lcoal repo will now have new parts that werent put there by the person working on
	this version.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	- Forks: These are create by Github and is their art of cloning a repository.
	- Clones: It is the act of using 'git clone' or 'git push' to extract or download a repository. It is also making
	a local copy of the repo.
	- Branches: they different part ways which at some point relate to one another but don't interact with each other.
	- When to use:
		- If you are making a copy of someone repo using Github instead of downloading to a local computer to then upload to Github then use FORKS
		- If you want to make a copy of someones repo on your local computer then use CLONE
		- If you are creating a repository on Github and want to upload then you CLONE 'git push'
		- If you sant to experiement with different features or ideas without messing with the master branch then you create BRANCHES.
