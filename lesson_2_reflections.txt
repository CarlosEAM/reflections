What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	After running the 'git init' command a folder named .git is created which 
is used to store all the metadata of the repository. This is how git repositories are
create that is why it needs doing.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is a place where you, manually, add the files you want to add to the 
next commit. It doesn't include all files but the ones you put in there and the working 
directory is the current location you are within the filesystem unlike the repository which
is the grouping of files within a working directory however it need not be all the files within
the working directory.
